# Machine Learning to Classify Intonemes into Speech Segments in Spanish

It is about the implementation in Python of a tool to automatically classify speech segments that contemplate unitary phrases according to the typology of intonations established by the renowned Cuban intonology Dra.C. Raquel M. García Riverón for the Spanish spoken in Havana.

The solution is given with the use of Machine Learning, Wavelet Theory and Data Augmentation.

The graphical interface is shown by executing:

```bash
python visual.py
```

The [main.py](./main.py) file contains the main experiments run.


The [muestra](./muestra) folder has some of the **.wav** audio segments from the corpus separated by category.
